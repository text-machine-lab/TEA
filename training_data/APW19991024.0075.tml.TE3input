BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) --

About 500 people attended a Sunday night memorial service for the Buffalo-area physician who performed abortions, one year after he was killed by a sniper's bullet.

A nurse who was critically injured in the 1998 abortion clinic bombing in Birmingham, Ala., was among those who attended the interfaith ceremony at a Presbyterian church for Dr. Barnett Slepian.

Police kept watch outside and about 25 undercover police were scattered throughout the crowd.

``Security is tight,'' said Marilynn Buckham, of Buffalo Gyn Womanservices, a sponsor of the ceremony. ``But it's not tonight we're worried about. It's all of the other dark nights.''

A memorial service planned at the University of Rochester for Saturday was canceled after security plans were leaked.

Slepian was killed on Oct. 23, 1999 by a sniper hiding in his backyard. Earlier that day, the Slepian family sent a fax to local police explaining that abortion providers were warned that one of them might be targeted for assassination.

On May 6, James Kopp, 44, was charged with the slaying. Kopp remains at-large and police admit that despite a worldwide search and a $1 million reward, they don't know where he is.

``It's very frustrating knowing that he's out there,'' said Ms. Buckham. ``It's very scary.''

Sunday's yahrtzeit service ---- a Jewish ceremony that commemorates the dead with the lighting of a 24-hour candle ---- included the lighting of candles for the seven people killed and 12 people injured in abortion-related violence since 1993.

A tearful audience also listened to registered nurse Emily Lyons, who has undergone a number of operations since the Alabama clinic bombing and has permanently damaged eyesight. She spoke of Slepian and other abortion providers who have been killed.

``They paid an awful price for reproductive freedom and the women they served,'' she said. ``They risked their lives for that freedom.''
